# A Java software to visualize 3D models (.gts format)

This software has been written by me and another student during our last DUT semester back in 2015.  
It includes the following features:
- Importing models from the hard drive to the application
- Exporting model from the application to the hard drive
- Rotating and translating the model
- Switching model representation between points, segments and faces
- Basic lighting for the model face view
- Searching for a specific model using a keyword
- Editing model information such as the description and its keyword
- Multiple tab for model viewing

Please note that this software was written many years ago when we just started learning programming so the code is not that nice...
